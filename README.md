## Background

The dataset we cited originally from Kaggle is intended to provide an analysis and prediction to the heart attack by using corresponding machine learning models. The drive we planned to investigate this special topic can be attributed to Simmons' findings in 2021, in which he clarified due to the complexity and the variations of the increasing number of risk factors, modern researchers are depending on Machine Learning techniques to make the further breakthroughs on this challenging topic. Besides, according to Garg, Khan and Sharma(2020), Heart Attack Prediction by using machine learning technique has started to play a significant role in the medical care and other corresponding research fields.

## What we do

There are mainly 2 parts of our project:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA stage, our goal was to identify the main factors that contribute to the occurrence of heart attacks in the dataset. We are particularly interested in examining the impact of age on heart disease, as it is commonly assumed that older individuals are more susceptible to developing heart disease compared to younger individuals.

### Classification and Prediction

During the latter part of our project, we aim to utilize multiple machine learning models to forecast the likelihood of a heart attack using our dataset, and analyze their respective performances. The input features we consider span from the first to the thirteenth columns. The output value we're trying to predict is situated in the fourteenth column, named 'output', where the value 0 denotes a lower likelihood of a heart attack, while 1 indicates a higher likelihood. We intend to apply a total of six different models: `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`, `Support Vector Machine`, `K-Nearest Neighbors`, `Naive Bayes`, and `Multi-layer Perceptron of Neural Network`.
